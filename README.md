### **Project Title: Supermarket Sales Analysis Using Python**

The Supermarket Sales Analysis project is a comprehensive data analytics initiative aimed at extracting actionable insights from transactional data of a retail supermarket. The project leverages **Python** and several powerful data science libraries to clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and overall business operations. The ultimate goal is to assist supermarket managers and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions for boosting revenue, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing inventory and operations.

### ðŸ§­ **Project Objectives:**

- Analyze overall sales performance across multiple branches  
- Identify best-selling and underperforming products  
- Understand customer purchasing behavior based on gender, time, payment method, and product category  
- Track revenue patterns over time to support marketing and stock planning  
- Visualize key performance indicators through clear, interactive dashboards

### ðŸ§¼ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**

The dataset contained features like invoice ID, customer type, gender, product line, total amount, payment method, date and time of purchase, gross income, and branch.

Key preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values and correcting inconsistent data entries  
- Converting date and time columns to proper datetime formats  
- Creating new time-based features: day, month, weekday, and hour  
- Encoding categorical features for deeper analysis  
- Aggregating data at different levels (daily, monthly, by branch/product line)

### ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- **Branch-Level Analysis**: Compared revenue, transaction volume, and gross income between branches  
- **Customer Behavior**: Assessed purchase habits based on gender and customer type (member vs. non-member)  
- **Product Line Insights**: Identified which product categories brought in the highest revenue and gross income  
- **Payment Method Patterns**: Evaluated popularity of different payment options (Cash, Ewallet, Credit Card)  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzed sales performance over different days, hours, and months  
- **Correlation Study**: Explored relationships between unit price, quantity, and total sales

---

### ðŸ“ˆ **Visualizations:**

- **Bar charts** and **pie charts** to highlight sales by branch, payment method, and gender  
- **Line plots** for visualizing time trends in revenue and transaction volume  
- **Heatmaps** to reveal peak sales times across weekdays and hours  
- **Boxplots** for detecting outliers in transaction values  
- **Interactive dashboards** (via Plotly or Streamlit) for live data filtering and visual storytelling

### âœ… **Key Insights & Results:**

- **Evening hours** (around 6 PM) showed the highest footfall and purchase activity  
- **Branch B** consistently generated the highest revenue and customer visits  
- **Electronic payment methods** were the most preferred, suggesting a shift toward digital transactions  
- **Health and Beauty** and **Food and Beverage** were the top-selling product lines  
- Loyal customers (members) contributed more to gross income than one-time customers
